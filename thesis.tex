\chapter{Introduction}

Previously, it was almost impossible for people to share information globally.
However, this has changed drastically in recent decades with the rise of the
Internet. Each and every year, the number of people using it grows. Over
63\,\% of people worldwide can utilize it to convey or acquire new
information~\cite{w3_wordpress}. With the increased usage also comes
an increase in available resources. While this is great for variety, it also
sometimes creates an obstacle for anyone searching for valuable learning
materials.

European Network for Academic Integrity (ENAI) is an organization comprising
higher education institutions that strives to support its members and the public
in the field of academic integrity. An interactive database of educational
materials has been made available on the ENAI to combat the issue and has seen
considerable success since its conception.

The thesis bases itself on the previous iteration of this database application,
originally created as a more general plugin for WordPress. The plugin offered
a system supporting the management of educational materials to anyone employing
WordPress. While still widely used, the ENAI personnel wanted to move from
WordPress to a more customized solution. Such a decision demands the
reimplementation of the plugin. The rework is also used to introduce new
features, refine the existing ones, and tailor the application specifically to
the needs of ENAI members.

The application uses PHP as its \mbox{server-side} language, supported by a CodeIgniter4
framework. Frameworks provide many benefits, such as speeding up development by
providing many \mbox{often-used} functions or enhancing security and maintainability.
The project is designed to be a standalone web application, a small content
management system. It must be as portable as possible, with only a few steps
needed to run on most servers that support PHP. The user side of the application,
or front end, uses HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript under the ECS6 standard.

The application can be divided into two almost separate areas, one accessible to
anyone and the second restricted behind an authentication system.

The public features a view of single or all materials. It allows users to
download attached files and view related subjects and websites. The searching
supports suggestions and, along with filtering, should be easy to grasp and
control.

The second one is an administration area. It allows easy and intuitive management
of materials. The management contains the creation, updating, and deletion of
taxonomies, accounts, and files. A dashboard is included to allow viewing of
statistics of use.

\section{Thesis structure}

The second chapter takes a look at the overall context. The third chapter
focuses on the analysis of requirements. The fourth one focuses on design decisions,
showcasing select diagrams. The fifth chapter focuses on selected implementation
details and challenges. The sixth chapter evaluates the work and offers
additional insights and possible future improvements.

\chapter{Prerequisites}

\section{European Network for Academic Integrity}

“The European Network for Academic Integrity (ENAI) is an association gathering
educational institutions and individuals interested in maintaining and promoting
academic integrity”~\cite{enai_about}. It aims to support its members and
the public in the field of academic integrity, being the most extensive academic
integrity network in Europe. Aside from organizing the European Conference on Ethics
and Integrity in Academia, ENAI also provides several free services to the public,
such as a glossary on academic integrity, monthly webinars, self-assessment tools,
support for the victims of academic misconduct or a database of educational materials.

The mentioned database is one of the key players in supporting its efforts.
The database runs on a WordPress plugin~\cite{lang18} made by Leoš Lang.
Its caretakers wish to have it remade into a separate web application. Together
with this request, they want to change or remove several old features. Those
conditions are examined later in section~\ref{chap:analysis}.

\section{E-learning}

The first appearance of \mbox{e-learning} dates to the \mbox{mid-1960s}, but
the real growth began much later with the growth of the Internet in the late
90s~\cite{research_e-learning}. Since then, many forms of \mbox{e-learning}
have come into existence, be it interactive forms like videos or more passive
ones like \mbox{e-books}.

Most of the forms can be described by the following definition:  “E-learning is the use
of electronic technologies to create learning experiences”~\parencite[page.~1]{horton11}.
Learning is experienced with the usage of learning objects. “A learning object is a chunk
of electronic content that can be accessed individually and that ultimately accomplishes
a single learning objective and can prove it”~\parencite[page.~47]{horton11}. At its core,
an interactive database is an application of the previously mentioned definition.
Each material in the database then represents a singular learning object.

\section{Content management systems}

“A content management system (CMS) is primarily a repository for multimedia content
objects”~\parencite[page.~17]{mauthe04}. According to this definition, three main
areas every CMS should provide can be identified:

\begin{itemize}
    \item collection - acquiring information into the system, be it from existing
    or newly created sources.
    \item management - modifying or removing information that has already been
    collected and saved into the system.
    \item publishing - making the content available to the users through the web,
    e-mail, or any other means, such as printed copies.
\end{itemize}

For this thesis, it is important to mention two concrete kinds of CMS. First, an aim
of the thesis. A system that handles educational materials directly and simplifies
the collection and management operations for the user. The other one is more advanced
but serves a different purpose. It allows any user to create and manage websites
without prior programming knowledge. One of these is WordPress, mentioned in
section~\ref{sect:wordpress}.

\section{PHP}

Hypertext PreProcessor (PHP) is the currently most used \mbox{server-side} scripting
language. Being an \mbox{open-source} project able to run on most operating systems
ensures portability to almost any server. Its main advantages are platform and database
independency or easy understandability with \mbox{C-like} syntax. It offers many
library functions by default, such as array or hashing helpers, easing the burden
on developers. PHP code can be embedded into HTML files. The server reads and
alters the contents based on the embedded code before sending the page to the
user~\parencite[page.~30]{welling17}. PHP is very fast and scalable. It can also
service virtually any content, whether in the form of small project or
a \mbox{large-scale} website like Facebook. The updates to PHP are mostly backward
compatible, so little or no changes are usually required.

\section{WordPress}
\label{sect:wordpress}

\subsection{About}

WordPress is the most popular content management system. It is an \mbox{open-source}
platform running on PHP that allows anyone to contribute to its improvement.
Due to the rapid development and wide range of downloadable plugins and themes,
WordPress maintains a high following. It is used by 63.3\,\% of all websites whose
content management system is known or 43.2\,\% in total~\cite{w3_wordpress}.

WordPress has a large and active community of users who share knowledge and
resources related to WordPress development. The use of WordPress plugins
enabled developers to participate in this community and leverage existing
WordPress features and knowledge.

\subsection{Plugins}

The core of WordPress is designed to be more lightweight and flexible. A WordPress
plugin is a collection of PHP scripts that can be accompanied by custom stylesheets
and templates. Their purpose is to extend the core with additional functionalities.
They can make changes to the database, show content to users, integrate into
administration, automate tasks (such as comment filtering), or function as
a separate application.

\subsection{Negatives}

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item \textbf{Security}: Due to its popularity, WordPress is a favorite of hackers
and malicious users. WordPress websites are often vulnerable to security breaches.
Using WordPress plugins may introduce additional security risks to the site, as the
plugins sometimes have vulnerabilities or may not have been adequately maintained.
	
	\item \textbf{Performance}: WordPress can be slower and less efficient than a pure
PHP application because a WordPress site requires extra overhead for running the CMS
and plugins. The usage of plugins can cause issues and noticeably slow down the site,
especially if it is implemented poorly.
	
	\item \textbf{Flexibility}: While WordPress offers a lot of customization flexibility,
it can also be limiting in some ways. Using WordPress plugins requires web developers
to work within the constraints of the WordPress framework, which may restrict the
ability to use certain features or functionality. This is primarily true in the administration
user interface, making it harder to simplify specific tasks. Templating also makes causes
sites to look identical.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Existing solutions}

A search for a freely available and finished solution to the problem was conducted. The search revealed two distinct system design trends, each having a sizeable following. The following text elaborates further on those trends, adds several examples, and mentions why they are not used for the project.

\subsection{Courses}

The first trend is systems categorized as Learning Management Systems (LMS). Those systems are a kind of CMS, albeit with a more specific focus. This focus is on delivering courses. The terms 'course' and 'educational material' are often used interchangeably, but the two have a number of key differences.

A course is a structured educational experience that is designed to provide learners with a specific set of learning outcomes or objectives. A course typically has a defined start and end date and may be delivered in a variety of formats, such as in-person classes, online modules, or a combination of both. Courses usually have a set curriculum outlining their topics and learning activities. They may include assessments or evaluations to measure the learner's progress and understanding.

Educational material refers to any content or resource designed to support learning and education. Such resources include textbooks, videos, tutorials, articles, and more. Unlike a course, educational material is often self-paced and self-directed, meaning that learners can access and use it on their own schedule and at their own pace.

While both courses and educational material aim to support learning and education, courses are generally more structured and have clear outcomes, and require more preparation work before release. On the other hand, educational materials are more flexible from a creation standpoint. They also allow learners to choose which resources to use to support their learning goals in parts.

Some of the course-focused systems are:
\begin{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Moodle} [https://moodle.org/] is a very popular platform. It was created in 2002 by Martin Dougiamas, an educator from Australia. Nowadays, it has more than 160000 sites in no less than 240 countries. Moodle provides a wide range of features, including course management, assessments, collaboration tools, and more. It is extensible with plugins.

	\item \textbf{Open edX} [https://openedx.org/] is an open-source platform for delivering massive open online courses created by edX, a non-profit organization founded by Harvard and MIT. One of the key features is its modular architecture, which allows for easy customization and extension. It has a large and active community of developers and users who contribute to the platform's development and support, enhancing its overall functionality.

	\item \textbf{Canvas} [https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms] is a platform that includes features such as course management, assignments, quizzes, and discussions, as well as integration with other tools such as Google Drive, Zoom, and Microsoft Office. Canvas is written in Ruby programming language. Ruby is unavailable on the current hosting [https://w3techs.com/sites/info/forpsi.com].

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Other}

The other premade solutions are systems similar to WordPress. However, even with a CMS, the application would need to be built from scratch. Moreover, since the work already aims to replace the existing WordPress plugin with a custom PHP solution, using another CMS would defy the purpose. Due to those reasons, this group is ignored too.

Some of the considered open-source instances were:
\begin{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Omeka} [https://omeka.org/] is specifically designed for creating and managing digital collections and exhibits. It includes features such as customizable themes, metadata management, and access control to create a flexible and organized environment for digital content.
	
	\item \textbf{MediaWiki} [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki] is used by many organizations to create and manage wikis. It includes features such as page editing, version history, and access control that help create a collaborative and organized environment for content management. While it could be used for the application, there are better choices for material management.

\end{itemize}

Oficiální zadání:

European Network for Academic Integrity (ENAI) is a consortium of higher education institutions
aiming to support their members in the field of academic integrity. One of the key means of
support is an interactive database of educational materials available from the ENAI website.
The database has been widely used by students and academics from all around the world.

The main task of the student will be to redesign and reimplement the content management
system with regard to the feedback collected from the users. Specifically, the CMS should
not rely on WordPress but become a stand-alone application. The other requirements include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item make filtering and searching more user-friendly
    \item implement user-friendly administration of the materials, including a tool to
    analyse search queries and the use of materials
    \item refine the system of tags, categories and other metadata
    \item implement support for materials available in multiple languages
\end{itemize}

Besides the regular contact with the supervisor, this topic includes also intensive
communication in English with the ENAI executive manager, who will serve as a thesis
consultant.
